# Thesis_Prototype
Interface prototype for community driven text simplification. 
The prototype consists of two parts: (1) a very simple game 
built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) (2) and the GUI for the text 
simplification program.

## Install
Installation requires the variable 'location' to be set.
Do this via the commandline when the target is called.

Usage:
```
make install location=<install directory>
```

Example:
```
make install location=$HOME/public_html/
```
